All code made by us is in the "Assets" folder;
all other files are generated by Unity. In order
to run this project, this repository must be cloned
and then opened in Unity.

Within Assets, there are several more files and folders.
There is an audio mixer that is used to control volume.
There are some images that were used for buttons and other UI elements.
"Animations" stores animations for sprites such as the player.
"Physics Objects" includes one physics object used to apply no friction to surfaces.
"Prefabs" are game objects that are saved for ease of use when making more levels.
"Scenes" are the different places the game takes place, such as the main menu and different levels.
"Sounds" stores sounds for background music and hit sounds.
"Sprites32" stores sprites, or images, that are used for game objects.
"TextMesh Pro" was generated by Unity and is the text editor.
"Tile Map" stores the tiles as a collection of squares used to make the maps.
